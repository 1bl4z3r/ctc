# Click To Chat
Click-To-Chat is an API provided by WhatsApp to permit users to communicate without having to save contacts on phone first. I have used bundled this API in a website for better user-friendliness

# Why did you care to make this?
I have absolutely no idea. I had a previous version of this very thing which used Vanilla JS. Now, this version uses Jquery (A notable improvement in my standards). Additionally, I will try to make it a Progressive Web Application.

# Is this Open Source?
This is GitHub, so duh. Code is under GNU General Public License v3.0
